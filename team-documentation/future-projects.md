# Recommended Projects for New Team

-   [ ] Work with John to upgrade all computers
-   [ ] Need to upgrade CNC computer to Win10 + new hardware. Look at using alternative software to MasterCAM
-   [ ] Keep tabs on Octoprint development and switch to using a new version of access control, potentially integrated into LDAP/Active Directory if plugins are written or write own plugin. Will need to work with ENS/ETS to implement LDAP/Active Directory solution.
